Step 1: Program Objectives

The user of the program will be prompted to enter a numeric value reprsenting a length in inches. This length shall then be converted to centimeters.

Step 2: Program Design

Use some type of text box to prompt the user to enter the length in inches and to press enter when done.

Capture the input from the user and check that it is a number. Restart or abort if the input is something else than a number.

Convert the number from the user to centimeters by multpling the number by 2.54.

It is not specified what to do with the result but it is likely that it shall be presented to the user.
